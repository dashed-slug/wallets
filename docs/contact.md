# Contact support

Please use the [support forum on WordPress.org][wporg-support] for all issues and inquiries regarding the plugin.

Please use the [appropriate support forum][support] for the plugin's extensions.

You are welcome to send in any problems, questions, suggestions, thoughts, etc.

For all other communication, please contact [info@dashed-slug.net][email].

I make an effort to reply to all communication within 24 hours, Monday to Friday.

If you can, please try to follow these guidelines:

1. Please post your question at the appropriate forum.
   - The support forum for the main plugin, Bitcoin and Altcoin Wallets is at: https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wallets
   - You can also use the *General discussion* section if you prefer: [https://www.dashed-slug.net/forums/forum/general-discussion/][general-discussion]
   - The support forums for the plugin extensions are at: [https://dashed-slug.net/support][support]
   - You can also [email me][email].

2. Please try to post one thread for each issue. If you are facing a second or third issue, please post them in new threads. This helps me to address each issue individually. It also helps others who may be interested to read about the same issue.

3. Please *DO NOT* simply say that something is "not working". This is not helpful. I have no way of helping you if I don't know what the problem is. Please make an effort to describe your issue. If you see an error message, please paste it into your post. If necessary, upload a screenshot.

4. Remember, your question may already have an answer in the documentation, under _FAQ_ or _Troubleshooting_.
